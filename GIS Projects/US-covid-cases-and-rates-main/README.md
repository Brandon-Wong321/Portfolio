1. Map 1 displays the count of United States Covid Cases. This is sourced from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv). To display the magnitude of Covid cases in certain areas, a proportional symbol thematic layer is used to display the count data. Generally, we see a higher case count on the East and West coast bu this may also reflect the population demographics of those areas. An interactive feature available is if the user clicks on a proportional symbol, they will be able to see the case count for that county.

2. Map 2 displays the rate of United States Covid Cases. This map is a choropleth map depicting the Covid Case rate per 1,000 people across United States counties. A trend that can be observed from this map is higher rates of cases occuring in the mid west around the state of North Dakota, and along the Southwest States as well. The User may hover over any county to see the rate of a given area. The data was sourced from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv) Github while the Population data was gathered from the [2018 ACS 5-year estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true).
