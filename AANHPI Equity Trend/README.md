# Overview

This Project focuses on analyzing housing trends for AANHPI populations in the Puget Sound Region. I utilized Census PUMS 2023 data for my analysis using R. I discovered a 20% homeownership rate disparity among AANHPI populations highlighting the diverse experiences of different Asian populations. This analysis was published on the PSRC website and presented to PSRC's Growth Management Board. This analysis initiated analysis efforts for 3 jurisdictions.
